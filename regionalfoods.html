                <img src="https://www.chefspencil.com/wp-content/uploads/Risotto-Alla-Milanese.jpg.webp" alt="risotto" width="500">
                <p>Risotto is a typical northern Italian dish that can be cooked in an infinite number of ways. Creamy and rich in cheese, it is prepared with rice typical of northern areas, such as the Arborio, Carnaroli, and Vialone varieties, and cooked slowly in broth. <br>
                is prepared with white wine, Parmesan cheese, butter, onions, and saffron, which gives it its unmistakable yellow color. But it can also be made with many other ingredients such as pumpkin, red radicchio, mushrooms, sausage, or shellfish.</p> <hr>

                <p>Pizza. Inevitable if we speak about Italian food: pizza is a national symbol, a food that represents Italy in the world, and has been recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. <br>
                Every pizza maker has their own secrets and every pizza, made of flour, water, brewer’s yeast, and salt, can be stuffed or topped in many different ways. <br>
                The original pizza was created in Naples, in southern Italy, at the end of the 18th century in honor of the Queen of Italy, Margherita di Savoia. It is presented with a high “cornicione” (the edge) and is lower in the center, and is strictly baked in a wood-fired oven. <br>
                The “pizza margherita” is the most famous and simplest of pizzas, with its tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil, recalling the colors of the national flag. </p> <hr>

                <img src="https://www.chefspencil.com/wp-content/uploads/Spaghetti-alla-carbonara.jpg.webp" alt="pasta" width="500">
                <p>Another symbol, a national icon, loved all over the world, is pasta. Born in Sicily, in a short time it expanded its production to other regions by the sea that at the time had ports and an ideal climate for the drying of the product. Among the most famous areas are Naples and Imperia. <br> Rome, however, became the capital of spaghetti, and where “spaghetti alla carbonara” made history. It was born almost by chance, from the imagination of a young cook from Bologna, who added bacon with egg yolk, milk, cream, and cheese. <br> The recipe has changed little over the years and now includes bacon, egg yolk, and cheese. In the Italian capital, they also eat “bucatini al cacio e pepe” made with just butter, pepper, and pecorino cheese. The secret is to mix them at the right times. Another famous pasta dish is the “penne all’arrabbiata”—pasta with a spicy tomato sauce.

                <p>And after pasta, we had to follow with gnocchi, another typical Italian dish. Gnocchi are small rounds of potato dough. <br> Each region has its own variation, but the most typical ingredients are cheese, spinach, eggs, and a variety of sauces.</p> <hr>

                <p>Another cornerstone of Italian cuisine is lasagne. This baked dish, typical of Bologna, is made up of layers of fresh pasta covered in béchamel sauce and the famous “ragù bolognese.” <br> A sauce composed of sautéed celery, onion, and carrot to which pieces of beef, pork, and concentrated tomato are added is cooked slowly and for a long time.</p> <hr>

                <p>In Italy, it is a traditional dessert that is enjoyed all year round. It is eaten on walks, as a snack, or as a dessert at the end of a meal. It tends to be more consistent and richer than other “semifreddos,” and there are hundreds of gelato flavors. It will not be difficult, in Italy, to find places that make it perfectly. <br> What is your favorite ice cream flavor? ;)</p> <hr>

                <p>Italy is the kingdom of cured meats. Among the famous mortadella, salami, coppa, and culatello, the cured raw ham stands out, usually served as an appetizer. <br> It is also excellent as a snack in a sandwich or as a main course, cut into thin slices and accompanied by “piadina,” “gnocco” or “torta fritta,” “tigella,” “grissini,” “focaccia,” “pitta,” “michetta,” “mafalda,” “parrozzo,” or “biga,” depending on the city in which you are. <br> Each region has its own variant, but Parma ham is the best known. It is a DOC product, with an unmistakable sweetness, and has its ‘crown’, the branding mark, impressed with fire, which is only present on the original. It also has to pass strict tests to be considered authentic.</p> <hr>

                <p>A must-eat Sicilian dish that is perfect to enjoy when you are out for a walk: arancini. These are balls of rice with meat sauce, peas, and cheese that are breaded and then fried. Tasty and appetizing, every bite is a real pleasure.</p> <hr>

                <p>Its origins date back to the days of ancient Rome, and it is a simple dish made of corn flour from all regions of northern Italy. <br> Polenta is served in slices, even fried, to be brought to the table without seasoning, or as an accompaniment to various types of meat, with butter, soft cheeses, fish, or dishes that contain a lot of sauce.</p> <hr>

                <p>And dulcis in fundo (last but not least), we conclude this culinary journey through Italian tables with one of the most famous and envied national desserts, now known throughout the world: tiramisù. <br> Originally from the Veneto region, this cold spoon dessert owes its name to its alleged aphrodisiac effects. It consists of a base of Savoiardi biscuits, dipped in coffee and Marsala (a liqueur wine), covered with mascarpone cream, eggs, and sugar, with a sprinkling of cocoa.</p> <hr>
